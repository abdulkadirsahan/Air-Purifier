# Air-Purifier
Using an MQ-135 air quality sensor, a DHT11 temperature-humidity sensor, an OLED display, a computer fan, and a HEPA filter, I developed an air purification device. Data from the sensors is displayed on the OLED screen, and the fan activates when air quality exceeds a certain threshold.
